# VSCode Split

Do you love everything about IntelliJ except the way it splits windows? Rather it split like VSCode? Well, now it can!

## What is it?
An IntelliJ plugin that maps the MacOS keys (ctr + cmd + left/right) to window split functions.

## I don't see it on the IntelliJ Marketplace!
Well, it uses some internal APIs that Jetbrains doesn't appreciate, so it must be installed manually.

## How to Install
1. Download the latest zip file from the Releases page
2. Go to Settings > Plugins > [gear icon] > Install from disk
3. Select the downloaded zip
4. You may need to restart IntelliJ
